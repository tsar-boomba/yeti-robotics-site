## How to run

Clone the repo and then run <code>npm install</code> or <code>yarn add</code>.
Then run <code>npm start</code> to start a development version of the site.

## Hosting

The website is currently hosted through vercel. [You can go to this link to check out the current production deployment](https://yeti-robotics-site.vercel.app/). Also, you can look at environments in the right side-bar for current and past versions of the site. It is also deployed to my [personal domain, ibomb.website](ibomb.website), until access to the official domain is granted.
